# Davy-Jones-Locker-Crushing-Depths
Official Sequel to the Davy Jones Locker modpack by Tedyhere

This pack is intended to be like a Skyblock but underwater.  We intend to fundamentaly change how materials are gathered and even tho there is water everywhere, it won't be useful without treatment.  Salt water isn't good for you.  There will be unique sea life, both flora and fauna, and air will be essential but not easy to come by.

If you are interested in helping, please contact me and we can talk and see about adding you to the list.
